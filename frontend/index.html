      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">What's the Purpose?</p>
      <p>Hello, my name is Daryl Smith. I am a senior level IT Professional.</p>
      <p>These days I have been met with scepticism about how up to date my technical skill could be at this point in my career.
        So I decided to take on the Cloud Resume Challenge to prove that I have the skills and knowledge required to work with modern cloud and devop technologies.
      </p>
      <p>This site is hosted on AWS S3 and CloudFront, with an AWS Lambda function using a python script 
        involked by an API Gateway counting visitors and stored in a DynamoDB table, all deployed using 
        Terraform. </p>
